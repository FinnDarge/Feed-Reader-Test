# Project Overview

In this project from Udacity I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I took part and started to write more tests.

There were seven required tests that check the following:

1 RSS Feeds have to be defined
2 RSS Feeds have to be name
3 RSS Feeds have to be URL
4 The menu must be hidden by default
5 The menu must change when clicked (hidden / shown)
6 The initial entries must work
7 The new Feed must change compared to previous feed

When loading the html file you can see the jasmine tests at the bottom of the page. If it is green the tests were going fine, if the jasmine part is red there are some failures you can inspect.
